## Festival Tent

Standard tents are a disaster for events. People arrive with a cheap tent only to be set up, used for the duration and left behind resulting in loads of landfill waste and huge disposal costs to be absorbed by festival operators. This is where Pepaden Festival tent is great. Delivered directly to your event, easy to set up, and designed to last a week of rain, these tents can be recycled or composted after the crowds are gone, saving dump fees and the environment. As well as this, the tents can be printed on, painted on, and drawn on allowing for sponsorship opportunities and great fun for festival goers!  Not only do you save dumping costs, we can also provide set-up, waste disposal, maintenance and pens + art supplies to increase the quality of temporary accommodation to your customers.
